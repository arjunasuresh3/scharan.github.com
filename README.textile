This is a WIP of convering my wordpress based "blog":http://saicharan.in/blog to a static site based on Jekyll. The current version is available at "http://aws.saicharan.in":http://aws.saicharan.in. There may are a few known issues, and perhaps many unkown issues with the site, so please let me know in the comments of the "post":http://saicharan.in/blog/2011/08/21/migrating-to-jekyll/

p. The first phase is to get a Jekyll based template ready. Next I have to clean up the markdown generated by wordpressdotcom.rb migrator - quite a few posts are broken by the importer. For example, "http://aws.saicharan.in/page3/":http://aws.saicharan.in/page3/ (the navigation seems to be broken by the markdown for "this post":http://aws.saicharan.in/jekyll/2009/11/19/js-e-mail-validator/

The theme is based on the "Tumblr theme":http://munichtheme.tumblr.com. A Tumbler version is available "here":https://github.com/scharan/munich.

I put together this site based on a few resources:
* "https://github.com/mojombo/tpw":https://github.com/mojombo/tpw
* "https://github.com/krisb/jekyll-template":https://github.com/krisb/jekyll-template
* "https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data
* "https://gist.github.com/227621":https://gist.github.com/227621 (for pagination).

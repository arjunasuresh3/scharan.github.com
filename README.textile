This is a Github-blessed ("http://pages.github.com/":http://pages.github.com/), Jekyll-generated, Github hosted version of my blog. To make your own Github hosted site, simply create a repository name username.github.com and push the content into the master branch. More details here: "http://pages.github.com/":http://pages.github.com/ There may are a few known issues, and perhaps many unkown issues with the site, so please let me know in the comments of "this post.":http://saicharan.in/blog/2011/08/22/migrating-to-jekyll/

p. The first phase was to get a Jekyll template ready. Next I cleaned up the markdown generated by wordpressdotcom.rb migrator - quite a few posts are broken by the importer. <del>For example, "http://aws.saicharan.in/page3/":http://aws.saicharan.in/page3/ (the navigation seems to be broken by "this markdown":https://raw.github.com/scharan/saicharan.in/master/_posts/2009-11-19-js-e-mail-validator.html for "this post":http://aws.saicharan.in/jekyll/2009/11/19/js-e-mail-validator/)</del>

The theme is based on the "Tumblr theme":http://munichtheme.tumblr.com. A Tumbler version is available "here":https://github.com/scharan/munich.

I put together this site based on a few resources:
* "https://github.com/mojombo/tpw":https://github.com/mojombo/tpw
* "https://github.com/krisb/jekyll-template":https://github.com/krisb/jekyll-template
* "https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data
* "https://gist.github.com/227621":https://gist.github.com/227621 (for pagination).

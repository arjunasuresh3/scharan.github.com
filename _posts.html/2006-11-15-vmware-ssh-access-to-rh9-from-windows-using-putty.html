Refer to my <a href="http://sricharan-log.blogspot.com/2006/11/vmware-internet-access-from-guest-vm.html">previous post</a>Â regarding setting up Internet access via RH9 Guest OS. Make sure you have similar settings. Then, just change the firewall settings to allow incoming SSH connections.

Nothing else needs to be done.

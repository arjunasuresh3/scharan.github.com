Made some time to update the firefox extension at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/</a>

It was a more than a minor compatibility break. I have submitted the new version for review. But for those of you wish to test it for me, here is a link: <a href="http://saicharan.in/beta/saveuri/saveuri-0.3.3-fx.xpi">http://saicharan.in/beta/saveuri/saveuri-0.3.3-fx.xpi</a>

Warning: This has not yet been approved by a Mozilla reviewer - for testing only!

Instructions: If your Firefox browser saves the file rather than install it, simply drag and drop the file to the browser window and restart your browser!

<strong>Update: </strong>The extension has been approved and is now available at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/</a> Thanks everyone for the geek-joy!

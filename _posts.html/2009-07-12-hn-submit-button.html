I have been attempting to add "share" functionality to my website. Initially, I used the Digg button (<a href="http://digg.com/tools/integrate" target="_blank">http://digg.com/tools/integrate</a>) and Reddit button (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/button" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/button</a>).

Next I wanted to add <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> button. But there was none. But then again, there was this bookmarklet (<a href="http://ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html" target="_blank">http://ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html</a>). So I created the required HTML to get the required functionality, just using the bookmarklet:
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;a href="javascript:window.location=%22http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=%22+encodeURIComponent(document.location)+%22&amp;t=%22+encodeURIComponent(document.title)"&gt; Submit &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
Then I thought of making a Hacker News submit button, just like Reddit and Digg. So I decided to read the sources and build the HN button based on that.  Man, Digg's JS was such mess (yes, it was the minified version, but still, far too many lines of code). Reddit's was a great deal simpler, easy-to-read and intuitive. Check them out: <a href="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" target="_blank">http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/button.js" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/button.js.</a>

So I modelled the HN button based on Reddits' Javascript. Here it is: <a href="http://saicharan.in/work/hn.js" target="_blank">http://saicharan.in/work/hn.js</a> OR <a href="https://github.com/scharan/Goodies/blob/master/hn.js" target="_blank">https://github.com/scharan/Goodies/blob/master/hn.js</a>

To use it, simply include the following line:
<pre class="brush:html">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://saicharan.in/work/hn.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
Here is the code:
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/scharan/Goodies/raw/master/hn.js"></script>

<strong>Update:</strong> This article briefly made it to the front page of HN! I saw it at #19!. Here are the comments from HN: <a title="HN Button << Comments from HN" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=700053" target="_blank">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=700053</a>

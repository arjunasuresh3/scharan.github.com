I recently upgraded my Adobe Reader to version 8. The new interface is cool and all that, but I had an issue with using TeXnicCenter. Whenever I view a compiled document from TeXnicCenter, and then closed the Adobe reader or recompiled the file (causing adobe reader to close the document), the Adobe reader was crashing. A Google search yielded the following link which is very useful. It is almost a text-book type of solution which just works!http://dikkie.net/2007/02/16/texniccenter-and-adobe-reader-80/

Found this link on Google. It was reported as on the day of posting as a possibly problematic site. But I went on and found the info in that site very useful. So here is the link:<br />[http://www.lvlolvlo.net/2007/02/11/office-2007-on-a-thinkpad-ultranav-support-for-scrolling-fix/](http://www.lvlolvlo.net/2007/02/11/office-2007-on-a-thinkpad-ultranav-support-for-scrolling-fix/)<div class="blogger-post-footer">My experiments with Computers, Computing, Programming & Software.</div>

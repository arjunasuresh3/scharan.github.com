That is one hell of a software for forgetfulls like me. You can cover your desktop with post-its and even set off an alarm on specific notes!. Terrific! You can download the lite version from [here](http://dw.com.com/redir?pid=10508740&merid=59813&amp;mfgid=59813&ltype=dl_dlnow&lop=link&edId=3&siteId=4&oId=3040-2351_4-10508740&ontId=2351_4&destUrl=http://www.download.com%2F3001-2351_4-10508740.html). You can try the newest version for 30 days from [here](http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/digital/digital_notes.html). Beware! version 4.2 needs .Net framework 1.1. You can get that [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3&displaylang=en).The maker is father of paper-post-its -- [3M.](http://www.3m.com/)Three cheers to 3M!<div class="blogger-post-footer">My experiments with Computers, Computing, Programming &amp; Software.</div>

Once again, GDB comes to my rescue. Preparing for some exam, I need to debug. I need some advanced debug commands. Man pages are too long and do not provide examples. So, where do I go? To where I always went for GDB. To [Peter Jay Salzman's web site tutorial ofcourse](http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/)!It seems to have been recently updated and it is great. Very technical and yet understandable too! - a rare combination. It is still under massive reconstruction as the web site puts it, but still great to go.You can find his homepage [here](http://www.dirac.org/p/) and his usful linux notes [here](http://www.dirac.org/p/linux/).He seems to use all those things that I am interested in (kind of one-stop for me!), except that I use Matlab while he prefers Mathematica. His LaTeX links are [here](http://www.dirac.org/tex/). And [here](http://www.dirac.org/hackers/)is his list of hackers (both good and bad as he puts it.)<div class="blogger-post-footer">My experiments with Computers, Computing, Programming &amp; Software.</div>

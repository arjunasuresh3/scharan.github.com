Today, SaveURI- a firefox extension that I wrote is ready. It was a litte difficult to get things going, but it was fun.By the way, this extension simply saves the URI or URL of every page that you save so that you don't have to search for the parent site link. This was a problem I had for long, especially when I was doing my master's project. The links were just not available on any of the pages that I had saved. I needed them all for my report references. I am glad I could solve my own problems.You can download the extension [here](http://scharan20.googlepages.com/SaveURI.xpi). Just be careful if you are using the CustomizeGooogle extension as SaveURI is in the test phase and WILL clash with the latter extenssion.<div class="blogger-post-footer">My experiments with Computers, Computing, Programming &amp; Software.</div>

Very frequently my friends ask for my reading list. So I decided to follow the [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) principles to help them and help myself. Hence this blog entry. Here goes:My favourite tech blogs/sites:Programming blogs:1. [codinghorror.com](http://codinghorror.com/)2.

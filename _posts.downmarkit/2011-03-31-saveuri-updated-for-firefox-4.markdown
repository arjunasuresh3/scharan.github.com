Made some time to update the firefox extension at [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/)It was a more than a minor compatibility break. I have submitted the new version for review. But for those of you wish to test it for me, here is a link: [http://saicharan.in/beta/saveuri/saveuri-0.3.3-fx.xpi](http://saicharan.in/beta/saveuri/saveuri-0.3.3-fx.xpi)Warning: This has not yet been approved by a Mozilla reviewer - for testing only!Instructions: If your Firefox browser saves the file rather than install it, simply drag and drop the file to the browser window and restart your browser!**Update: **The extension has been approved and is now available at [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveuri/) Thanks everyone for the geek-joy!

<ul>
	<li>There is nothing special that you need to do incase you need to run Minix on VMWare. Infact, you can download the VMWare ready image of Minix from here. Only, this image is not allowing ftp access to VMWare. After much effort, I found an image file for Minix 2.0.4 which was consolidated. The website is so confusing. It does not specify clearly what needs to be downloaded and they have lots of things there too!!!</li>
	<li>To allow ping to work, just set up NAT as described <a title="VMWare" href="http://sricharan-log.blogspot.com/2006/11/vmware-internet-access-from-guest-vm.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Read <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/0d6ca6030eba125a">this post</a> or <a href="http://sricharan-log.blogspot.com/2006/11/minix-ftp-tlenet-access.html">this post</a> to enable FTP and Telnet access to Minix.</li>

Here are a few more reflections from people I read:

- [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned)
- [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/08/25/thanksSteve.html)
- [David Pogue](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/steve-jobs-reshaped-industries/)
- [Marco Arment](www.marco.org/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo) closes with -

> Steve, if for some crazy reason you're reading this:
>
> You've defined a generation and changed the world.
>
> Thank you.
>
> We wish you the best.

May be I'll add a few more as they pop up.

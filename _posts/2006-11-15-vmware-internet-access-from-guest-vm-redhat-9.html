<ul>
	<li>You donot need to create any internet sharing in windows etc. VMWare will take care of that for you.</li>
	<li>To set up internet access from the guest VM, set the VM to use NAT for ethernet.</li>
	<li>Set the IP address to the same segment as that of VMNet8. (just make sure that it is not .2).</li>
</ul>
Now you can access the Internet from the Guest VM!

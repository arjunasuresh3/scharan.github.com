Since this morning, the memory of a computer game that I played as a kid kept surfacing in my head. Weirdly, the name kept eluding me; until a Google search for ['computer clay game'](https://www.google.com/search?q=computer+clay+game) turned up the one and only 'Neverhood Chronicles' :)

Here is an image sourced from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood):
[![The Neverhood](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/The_Neverhood.jpg "The Neverhood!")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood)

The opening line is unassumingly simple: 

> "_Hello.  Me Willie.  Me Willie Trombone. You read this, you do good.  Willie happy.  <br />
> You play Neverhood you do more good.  And look out for bad.  <br />
> Willie knows, bad is always where you forget to look_."

Well, getting it running was painstakingly hard, even given its extremely modest system requirements:

- Pentium 75 mhz
- 8 Mg RAM (16 recommended) 
- 1 Mg VRAM 
- SVGA monitor 
- Quad speed CD ROM
- 8-bit sound card & speakers  (16-bit recommended) 
- 10 Mg available hard disk space for Installation
- Microsoft Windows 95.

Luckily, I tend to preserve my old original CDs/DVDs. And, with a little help from the free [Windows VirtualPC](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx), its pure gεεk joy!

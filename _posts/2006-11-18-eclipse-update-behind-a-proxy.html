Updating Eclipse from behind a proxy was quite counter-intuitive for me; or was it??? I had expected to find the proxy setting in the same window where the updater hooks up to the internet. Unfortunately, with Eclipse, it was under Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Install/Update &gt; Use HTTP Proxy...
But this option of not having to hunt around the eclipse site for the plug-ins is a real killer concept. Saves a lot of time too. One up to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>project.

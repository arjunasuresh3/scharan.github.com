Each time I use Google from office, Google responds in Thai. I fixed that by going to <a href="www.google.com/ncr">www.google.com/ncr</a>.<br /><br />Now onwards, I hope to always get results in English :) Btw, if you happen to clear your cookies, you should go to <a href="www.google.com/ncr">www.google.com/ncr</a> again.<div class="blogger-post-footer">My experiments with Computers, Computing, Programming & Software.</div>

title: The Best GDB tutorial....

Once again, GDB comes to my rescue. Preparing for some exam, I need to debug. I need some advanced debug commands. Man pages are too long and do not provide examples. So, where do I go? To where I always went for GDB. To <a href="http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/">Peter Jay Salzman's web site tutorial ofcourse</a>!
It seems to have been recently updated and it is great. Very technical and yet understandable too! - a rare combination. It is still under massive reconstruction as the web site puts it, but still great to go.
You can find his homepage <a href="http://www.dirac.org/p/">here</a> and his usful linux notes <a href="http://www.dirac.org/p/linux/">here</a>.
He seems to use all those things that I am interested in (kind of one-stop for me!), except that I use Matlab while he prefers Mathematica. His LaTeX links are <a href="http://www.dirac.org/tex/">here</a>. And <a href="http://www.dirac.org/hackers/">here</a>is his list of hackers (both good and bad as he puts it.)

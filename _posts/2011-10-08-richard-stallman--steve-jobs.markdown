Richard Stallman [wrote](http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#06_October_2011_(Steve_Jobs\)):
> Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died.
>
> As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, "I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone." Nobody deserves to have to die - not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of Jobs' malign influence on people's computing.

> Unfortunately, that influence continues despite his absence. We can only hope his successors, as they attempt to carry on his legacy, will be less effective.

When I first read it, I was shocked. Somehow, my respect and admiration for Steve, and the news of his demise seemed to confuse the whole thing. Perhaps, I thought, Stallman did not wait 'the appropriate amount of time' after Jobs' passing - but hey, what is the appropriate amount of time? As [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/thoughts_and_observations_iphone_4s) put it, '...life goes on.'

I could sense a fringe thought that I seemed to be actively fending away: that there was some truth in Stallman's words; and that he was being very respectful in what he said. But then, I could not place my thoughts - like I mentioned earlier, I seemed to be in a limbo of sorts. 

And then there was light! Dave Winer, the guy credited with inventing RSS, first tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/#!/davewiner/status/122417111640453121) 
> Stallman's epitaph for Jobs is appropriate and respectful. http://r2.ly/7f3u

and followed up with [this](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/08/stallmanSteve.html). And I seem to agree - Stallman was right; and appropriately respectful too. Brilliant, well thought out & effectively communicating piece of writing from Dave.

To relate with the concluding paragraph from Stallman, it helps to be familiar with Apple's 'Think Different' ad campaign. A transcript of it is here: <http://saicharan.in/blog/2011/10/06/heres-to-the-crazy-ones/>

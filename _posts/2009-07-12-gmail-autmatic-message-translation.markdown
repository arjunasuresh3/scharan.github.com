This morning GMail surprised me yet again. Opening an email, I saw a new functional bar: Translate this message: From:&lt;Language&gt; To:&lt;Language&gt;.

I tried out the machine translation from English to Hindi. It was amazing. Took under 2 second (yes, to send the request to the servers, do the translation and to render the translated text on the browser window).

There was also that pretty helpful (right-)side bar: "Translate this conversation".
Pretty neat translation. And very seamless user experience too! Man I am blown away.

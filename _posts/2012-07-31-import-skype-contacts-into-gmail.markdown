Gmail's contact details includes provision to add usernames from other IM networks. Having this in one place is very handy on the Android phone, for instance. 

NaÃ¯vely exporting Skype's address book via Skype > Contacts > Advanced > Backup contacts to file & importing them into Gmail isn't sufficient. This process imports the contact information alright, but not the skype names, defeating the purpose of the import.

A little digging up reveals the culprit. Skype uses the vCard v3.0 Property `X-SKYPE-USERNAME:`, while Gmail expects `X-SKYPE:`. So, here is some wizardry to fix this (on a Linux/Unix machine).

- Export contacts to skypename.vcf file from Skype > Contacts > Advanced > Backup contacts to file, and copy it to a linux machine.
- I did not want the pictures of my Skype contacts to be imported. I filtered out the relevant fields using:
      egrep "^BEGIN:|^END:|^VERSION:|^TEL;|^EMAIL:|^ADR:|^N:|^FN:|^X-SKYPE-USERNAME:" skypename.vcf > skype-cleaned.vcf
- Change the vCard property to match Gmail's expectations:
      sed -i s/-USERNAME// skype-cleaned.vcf
- Prettify the vCard file to include newlines after each vCard entry _(note: this step is not absolutely necessary)_.
      sed -i "s/^END:VCARD/END:VCARD\\`echo -e '\n\n'`/g" skype-cleaned.vcf
- Import skype-cleaned.vcf into Gmail & choose to merge contacts appropriately.

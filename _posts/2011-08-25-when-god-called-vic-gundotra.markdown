Being an Apple fanboy, I enjoyed this piece. It is interesting that after Steve Jobs resigned, many such stories have surfaced.

Vic Gundotra [recalls](https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/gcSStkKxXTw):

> Steve laughed. He said, "Vic, unless the Caller ID said 'GOD', you should never pick up during services". [...]

and concludes -

> But in the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I think back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January. It was a lesson I'll never forget. CEOs should care about details. Even shades of yellow. On a Sunday.
>
>To one of the greatest leaders I've ever met, my prayers and hopes are with you Steve.

Nice!

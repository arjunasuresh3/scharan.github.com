Two days ago, my system became damn slow. Then, I started looking at the processes and services running. Then, I Googled them and found these amazing sites:

*) qttask : QuickTime Task
*) cftmon :The cftmon.exe process is a component used in MsOffice to perform language related functions. It is closely tied to the 'Language Bar' present in MsOffice, so if you use the Language Bar you should leave this process running. If, on the other hand, you do not use the language bar, you should terminate this process to free up system resources.

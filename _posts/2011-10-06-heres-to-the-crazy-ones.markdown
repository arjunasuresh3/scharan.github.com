[The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/) linked to a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8rwsuXHA7RA) on Youtube and titled it ['Steve Jobs narrates The Crazy Ones'](http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-narrates-the-crazy-ones/). Here is a transcription (puctuation & emphasis is as I inferred, listening):

> Here is to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble makers. The round pegs in the square holes; the ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules and they have _no_ respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them; glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you **can't** do is ignore them - because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we, see genius. Because people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones _who do_.
